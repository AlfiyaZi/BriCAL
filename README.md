# BriCAL
BriCA Language Interpreter for BriCA Core Version 1


The BriCA Language is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for describing the structure of cognitive architecture mimicking the brain.  It describes networks consisting of modules having ports and connections between them.  Modules can be nested.  Currently port values are numeric vectors.

Language specification is found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8WCKFynadMEyRpl5c5o0Pdh2hoY9WHOM0jdSA-yiIE/edit)

The interpreter reads BriCA language files (currently language files are in JSON) and checks network consistency (NetworkBuilder class).  It also build BriCA agents based on the network to make it executable.
